        <p>Renée Verhoeven is an agro-ecologist and regenerative chef based in Rotterdam. She holds an MA from
            Wageningen University in Resilient Food and Farming Systems, and recently launched her catering business
            Renee’s Farm. Through her creative vegetarian cooking, she feeds us not only with seasonal and local foods,
            but also with her stories on the holistic farming practices behind them. Renée works towards running her own
            farmstead one
            day where these passions for cooking, organic farming and biodiversity can come together.</p>
