        <p>RenÃ©e is an agro-ecologist and regenerative chef with a
            Masterâ€™s degree in organic agriculture
            from Wageningen
            University. She recently launched her catering business, RenÃ©eâ€™s Farm, where she creates seasonal,
            locally-sourced
            vegetarian dishes. Her food isnâ€™t just about whatâ€™s on the plateâ€”itâ€™s about sharing the stories and farming
            practices behind it, feeding both body and thought.</p>
