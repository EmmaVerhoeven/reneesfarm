        <p>Renée is an agro-ecologist and regenerative chef with a
            Master’s degree in organic agriculture
            from Wageningen
            University. In her kitchen she creates seasonal,
            locally-sourced
            vegetarian dishes. Her food isn’t just about what’s on the plate—it’s about sharing the stories and farming
            practices behind it, feeding both body and thought.</p>
